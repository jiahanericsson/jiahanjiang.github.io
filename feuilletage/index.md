### quantity
for 5 20cm tarts

### ingredients
flour - 400g

butter - 50g

salt -8g

water - ~200g

butter (for turn) - 250g

### process (by hand)
---make the *détrempe*---

make sure butter is cold

*sabler* the butter and flour and make a well

add the salt and some of the water in the middle of the well and mix with all fingers until it is dissolved

mix the ingredients and knead without giving body to the dough until smooth (push metal scraper away from self to cute dough into small strips, then turn & repeat.  stretch a little bit in the process.)

add part or all of remaining water to correct consistency

make dough into a ball & cut an *x* into the top with a knife

let the dough rest for 30 minutes in the fridge

---make the *pâton*---

work the cold butter into a diamond shape (this is for both flattening the butter into shape and also working the butter so the consistency is similar to the dough)

roll out cold dough into a square

enclose the diamond-shaped butter into the square-shaped dough by folding over the sides

---make turns of the *pâton*---

2 simple or double turns & mark with fingers
relax in fridge for 30 min

2 more simple or double turns & mark with fingers
relax in fridge for 30 min

(leave as is until use.  if doing simple turns, give one more turn right before use.)
